## Getting Started
Clone or fork this repo and change the `url` and `puburl` in `_config.yml`

To learn how to install and use this theme check out the [Setup Guide][7] for more information.

### Prerequisites
You will need ruby and the ruby-gem github-pages installed on your computer, if you want to serve the Jekyll page locally.

I highly recommend using [rbenv][2]. Installation is easy if you already have [homebrew][3]:
```
$ brew install rbenv
```

### Ruby and rbenv
After you have rbenv installed, `cd` to your Jekyll site's directory, and install a Ruby version. This theme was tested on **2.4.0**:
```
# list available versions:
$ rbenv install -l

# install a ruby version (this might take a while):
$ rbenv install 2.4.0

# set the ruby version in the working directory:
$ rbenv local 2.4.0

# see which version is selected:
$ rbenv versions
```

### installing Gems
With rbenv **You don't need to SUDO**, but we do need to install some gems:
```
# everything we need is in github-pages, including jekyll
$ gem install github-pages

# we also need bundler
$ gem install bundler

# to install the required gems for this project specified in the gemfile
$ bundler install
```
you can checkout what [bundler][4] does.

if you are struck with some of these ruby/ gems/ bundler stuff, [this link][5] might be helpful.

### Serving Locally
```
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --watch    # the watch flag looks for real-time changes to files you edit
```
go to [`localhost:4000`][6] in your browser to see your site.
